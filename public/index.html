  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have tried all famous blogging platforms, Blogger, Wordpress, Tumblr, Posterous. Every time switching from one to another I saw some benefits. But I was still unsatisfied. I&#8217;m perfectionist and always looking for better ways to accomplish things. Something was still missing. Until I realized what.</p>

<p>I wanted to separate content from representation, have more control over my data, better integration with 3rd party services and cheaper or free hosting.</p>

<p>And here you go. Octopress satisfies all these whims.</p>

<p><strong>Octopress is based on Markdown.</strong> Markdown is set of conventions for formating text information. It&#8217;s designed for easy input and conversion to HTML or other formats. But it&#8217;s also readable in source form.</p>

<p>When I got some experience I decided to write all my documentation in Markdown. And blog is not an exception. It&#8217;s more convenient to type in Markdown rather than use different types of WYSIWYG editors.</p>

<p>Another side of using Markdown is separation of content from representation. If needed I can completely change how my posts are rendered. This type of flexibility is one of the things I was missing with other platforms.</p>

<p><strong>With Octopress I can store my posts in Git.</strong> This does not only mean version control. I can also keep backups on different servers and migrate easily from one hosting to another when I want.</p>

<p>If I am going serious about blogging I want to be sure my write-ups are kept in a safe and accessible form. This feeling of ownership is another thing I was missing with other platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Octopres requires only an HTTP server.</strong> In Octopress posts are stored in HTML files. There is no database. All content is served as static files. This boosts the performance significantly. Any simple and cheap hosting can do the job now. And there are some free options to get started, e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku.</p>

<p><strong>Octopress is usable out of the box.</strong> It comes with built-in integration with many 3rd party services. Comment out a few lines in configuration file and you get Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Disqus and other services connected to your blog.</p>

<p>Though default theme of Octopress looks very solid, we have full control over the look and feel of the site. Based on the design philosophy of Octopress and Jekyll (the static file generation engine) I would think that we have much more control that in any other platform. But I haven&#8217;t gone much into this yet. I still like the default theme.</p>

<p>I feel completely satisfied with Octopress now. And that feeling gives me additional motivation for new blog posts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The simple answer is because I feel I need to. But you are here not for that answer.</p>

<p>There are many write-ups about why should someone blog. They cover both objective and subjective benefits of blogging. This is not a generalization of these ideas. I want to tell about my personal reasons, the ones to which I came myself while learning through living my life.</p>

<p>Here are 5 reasons from the top of my head:</p>

<h3>I get it better if I write it down</h3>

<p>Since college years I noticed that when I write my ideas I get them better. Later I realized how it works.</p>

<p>When you write about something you need to think of every detail of it, make logical connections between pieces and represent it in a simple, readable form. And while performing these steps you think about the subject deeper, from different angles and as a result you get it better.</p>

<p>Since then whenever I want to crack complex subjects down I write them.</p>

<h3>Writing improves my writing skills</h3>

<p>I want to be good at English writing. Not good, even better.</p>

<p>The single most effective way of mastering something is constant practicing. And how do you practice writing? Right, by writing. But people normally don&#8217;t write much during the day, of course if that&#8217;s not what they do for living. I also don&#8217;t write much at my job.</p>

<p>So blogging makes a perfect sense to me for improving my writing skills.</p>

<h3>I want to share my knowledge</h3>

<p>Really, I want to share what I know to help others.</p>

<p>And I truly believe that it is also for my own sake. If people around me know as much as I do, then I need to learn even more to catch them up. This is a little secret tool to keep me in constant learning loop.</p>

<p>Actually I think knowledge sharing is a powerful motivator for constant learning.</p>

<h3>I want people to know me</h3>

<p>Ideally when meeting new people I would let them know my blog&#8217;s URL and they could learn about me eventually. In reality no one is going to read all the stuff I&#8217;m putting up here. Even if some of them do, I&#8217;m not going to write about everything.</p>

<p>But the blog can be used to express my opinion on a particular subject. Whenever they want my opinion on a subject, a blog post can be the answer. And the URL of the post can be thrown in for discussion. I find this an effective way of getting others to know me.</p>

<h3>I want to get followers</h3>

<p>I would like to be famous. Not kind of star-famous. Simply get like-minded people to read my blog regularly. Why do I need this? Come on, you know why. Read the about page again, I&#8217;m bootstraping my startups and I need to spread the word.</p>

<p>I belive if I post interesting and quality content regularly I may have a chance to get my followers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Finally I decided to give another shot to blogging. This is my third attempt.</p>

<p>If you skim over the previous blogs, you will see that it becomes more serious with every new attempt. And hopefully this time it&#8217;s already at the level of seriousness that I&#8217;ll stick to it.</p>

<p>Crossing fingers and stopping breath for a moment I think loudly &#8220;promise to take care of this one&#8221;.</p>

<p>More technically, I&#8217;m just writing something to test out this new blogging platform that I choose to make my life more difficult.</p>

<p>In short, Welcome!</p>
